   With the canvas on this page the user can deal
   cards and shuffle the card deck. The cards can be
   turned by clicking them with the mouse.

   Note that the program stops operating after all
   cards from the deck have been taken. It is your
   task to fix this problem when you study the code.

   This program shows how to:
      - build an application with several classes
      - how to manage many images
      - shuffle an array
      
   The images needed by this program must be in a folder
   named playing_cards_images. In the same folder where you
   found this file, there is a file named
   playing_cards_images.zip. By unzipping this file you
   get the necessary image files to work locally with this
   page.
